# Credit Card Approval Prediction: A Machine Learning Approach

**Abstract:**

Exploring the application of machine learning to predict credit card approvals. Using a publicly available credit card applications dataset, we employ data preprocessing techniques like missing value imputation, feature engineering, label encoding, and feature scaling. We then apply two classification models, Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier, optimized with GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these models in accurately predicting credit card approvals, with the Random Forest Classifier achieving slightly higher accuracy.

**1. Introduction:**

Credit card approval decisions are crucial for both financial institutions and applicants. Traditionally, these decisions relied on manual assessments, which can be time-consuming and prone to biases. Machine learning offers an automated and potentially more objective approach. This paper investigates the use of machine learning algorithms to predict credit card approvals based on applicant data.

**2. Dataset and Preprocessing:**

We utilize a publicly available dataset containing credit card applications. The dataset presents various applicant features, including demographic and financial information, and the final approval status.

Before applying machine learning models, we perform essential data preprocessing steps:

Missing Value Imputation: Missing values are replaced using robust techniques. Numerical features are imputed with the median to handle potential outliers, while categorical features are imputed with the most frequent value.
Feature Engineering: While this dataset does not require extensive feature engineering, this step could be incorporated to create new features from existing ones.
Label Encoding: Categorical features are converted into numerical representations using Label Encoding to make them suitable for machine learning algorithms.
Feature Scaling: All features are scaled using MinMaxScaler to ensure they have a similar range, preventing features with larger values from dominating the model.

**3. Model Selection and Training:**

We employ two popular classification models for credit card approval prediction:

Logistic Regression: A linear model widely used for binary classification tasks. We use GridSearchCV to find the optimal values for hyperparameters 'C' (regularization strength) and 'penalty' (regularization type).
Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and robustness. GridSearchCV is used to tune 'n_estimators' (number of trees) and 'max_depth' (maximum depth of each tree).

**4. Evaluation:**

We evaluate the models' performance using accuracy score and confusion matrix metrics. Accuracy measures the overall correctness of predictions, while the confusion matrix provides a detailed breakdown of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

**5. Results and Discussion:**

Both Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier achieved high accuracy in predicting credit card approvals. The Random Forest Classifier generally performed slightly better, suggesting its ability to capture complex relationships within the data.

The hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV played a vital role in optimizing the models' performance, emphasizing the importance of this step in achieving the best results.

**6. Conclusion:**

This study demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in credit card approval prediction. The data preprocessing steps ensured the data was suitable for modeling, while GridSearchCV facilitated the selection of optimal hyperparameters.

Future work could explore more sophisticated feature engineering techniques and alternative machine learning models, like Support Vector Machines or Gradient Boosting, to further enhance prediction accuracy. Additionally, investigating the explainability of these models can provide valuable insights into the factors driving credit card approval decisions.
